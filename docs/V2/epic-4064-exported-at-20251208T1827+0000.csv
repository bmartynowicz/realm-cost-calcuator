4076,Enabling the sales reps to do deeper discovery questions,feature,brian@realm.security,,"Requestor - Pete

More about what we can do.  Can we get a list of the integrations for the next 3 months.  Devon - We should take the whole list down to 45.  

There will be some we don't have.  If we hear them we just make notes.

Feedback from Codex:
- 4076 “deeper discovery + 45-integration roadmap” (docs/V2/epic-4064-exported-at-20251208T1640+0000.csv (line 2)): the app still just exposes a static multi-select of 19 sources with no notion of an upcoming integration list nor any way to capture “make notes when we don’t have it” feedback (index.html (line 132), src/data/catalog.ts (line 24)). Nothing in the repo helps reps probe discovery questions beyond picking a source.

4070,Display: Costs,feature,brian@realm.security,,"Requestor - Devon

Cost Data provided by Pete - 
$500k for 1TB in SIEM, Realm costs $70k per TB which includes data haven.
Brian - Costs of REAM is from product costs in Hubspot.
Firewall - 70%, Network - 60%, Endpoint - 50% reduction - Pete (Make it fixed points, and remove any nunance data from customers).

Total savings relative to cost of Realm, output would be an ROI ratio, total data reduced, aggregate volume and ratio relative to realm.  

Said another way

Output will be total percentage of reduction, aggregate volume reduced and ratio of ROI. if we are saving them 220 and its 2X the cost of Realm. - Pete
